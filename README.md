# Lung-Cancer-Prediction-with-Deep-Learning


Lung cancer is a disease where cells in the lungs grow out of control. It often starts in the lungs but can also spread to other parts of the body. The primary cause of lung cancer is cigarette smoking, but it can also result from exposure to other substances like asbestos or air pollution, as well as genetic and lifestyle factors. Lung cancer is a critical health issue affecting millions of people worldwide. This GitHub repository contains a dataset and code for predicting the likelihood of a patient developing lung cancer, identifying risk factors, and determining effective treatments based on various patient attributes.
